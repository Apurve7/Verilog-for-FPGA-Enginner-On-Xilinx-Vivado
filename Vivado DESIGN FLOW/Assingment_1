Question : Assume our half adder has input ports a, b, and Output ports as s,c. Use these ports to implement a Half adder in Verilog.

Solution :

`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top2(

    input a,b,

    output s,c

    );          /// | - OR , ~ - NOT, ^ -XOR , ~^ -XNOR, ~| -XNOR, ~| -NOR, ~& -NAND



    assign s = a^b;

    assign c = a&b;

   

endmodule
