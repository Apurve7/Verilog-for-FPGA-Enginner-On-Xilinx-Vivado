# Verilog for an FPGA Engineer with Xilinx Vivado Design Suite

This repository contains my assignment solutions and notes from the **Verilog for an FPGA Engineer with Xilinx Vivado Design Suite** course.  
It focuses on learning **Verilog HDL** for digital design and its implementation using **Xilinx Vivado** tools.

Verilog is a hardware description language used to model and design digital circuits at various levels of abstraction, from gate-level to system-level.  
Through this course, I explored the complete workflow of FPGA-based design — from writing Verilog code to synthesis, simulation, and implementation on real hardware.

The course covers:
- Fundamentals of Verilog HDL and its syntax  
- Combinational and sequential logic design  
- Testbench creation and functional verification  
- RTL design flow and synthesis  
- Implementation using the **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite**  
- Simulation and debugging using Vivado tools  
- Practical FPGA-based design methodology

These assignments helped reinforce my understanding of FPGA architecture, Verilog coding style, and the complete hardware design cycle using Vivado.  
The repository serves as a structured record of both theoretical understanding and hands-on exercises in FPGA design.
